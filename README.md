# Giphy Searcher

To practice front-end web development I decided to try to implementing a Giphy
Searcher. 

The code was initially written on [Scrimba][s], watch a timelapse of the prototype on
[YouTube][yt].

I got the idea from Garrett Levine's Medium post on [5 Projects To Complete when
Starting To Learn Frontend-End Web Development][m].

## Getting started

```
git clone https://github.com/scanf/giphy-searcher.imba
cd giphy-searcher.imba
yarn # npm install
```

You can run the app in two ways, either served via the webpack-dev-server or
Express.

### Webpack

```bash
# start webpack-dev-server and compiler
yarn run dev # npm run dev
```

### Server side

```
./node_modules/.bin/imba src/server.imba
```
